# Predictive-Checkpointing-for-Distributed-Systems-using-Machine-Learning

In distributed and high-performance computing systems, checkpointing is widely used to recover from failures. However, periodic checkpointing is often wasteful when failures are rare and can cause significant overhead due to frequent I/O operations. Conversely, infrequent checkpointing risks losing large amounts of computation. Current checkpointing strategies are reactive and fail to optimally balance reliability with performance.
Thought :- 
Can machine learning models be used to predict node failures in distributed systems, and can these predictions be leveraged to design adaptive checkpointing strategies that reduce overhead while maintaining reliability?
